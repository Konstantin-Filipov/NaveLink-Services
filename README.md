# Navallink Dashboard

Welcome to the Maritime Dashboard repository, a comprehensive web-based interface designed to streamline data compilation, visualization, and administration within the maritime sector. This dashboard is developed using Kotlin for the backend and provides a user-friendly experience for both general users and administrators.


### Basic Functions

1. **Marine Obstacle Detection**: Real-time monitoring of marine obstacles, including buoys, reefs, and other vessels, ensuring navigation safety. Technologies: JS, PYTHON, Navigation Algorithm, HTTP, UI. Steps: Data source acquisition, data processing.

2. **Navigation Path Planning**: Calculates the best navigation path based on target and current locations, avoiding dangerous areas and obstacles.

3. **GPS Integration**: Utilizes GPS data for precise vessel positioning, supporting navigation and position tracking.

4. **Real-time Map Display**: Displays ship's position, surrounding environment, and navigation path in real-time, aiding crew understanding of the sea situation.

5. **Alert and Notification System**: Provides warnings, hazardous situation alerts, and navigational advice, ensuring quick crew response.

6. **System Integration**: Integrates with internal warning solutions and navigation systems, enabling data sharing and collaboration.

### Advanced Functionality

1. **Radar and Sensor Integration**: Integrates radar and sensor data to enhance environmental perception, including weather conditions and sea state.

2. **Autopilot Support**: Offers autopilot features for autonomous navigation, adjusting to changing conditions.

3. **Channel Planning and Optimization**: Provides advanced channel planning considering maritime traffic and hydrological conditions, ensuring optimal and safe routes.

4. **Remote Monitoring and Support**: Allows remote monitoring of navigation and performance for remote technical support.

### Additional Features

1. **Historical Track Recording**: Records and stores the ship's historical navigation track for analysis and review.

2. **Crew Communication**: Integrated real-time communication tools for crew and ground support teams and other vessels.

3. **Custom Alert Settings**: Enables users to customize alerts and notifications based on specific sailing needs.

4. **Data Analysis and Reporting**: Provides tools for data analysis, generating reports on navigation performance and obstacle avoidance history.

5. **Machine Learning Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict sea states, obstacle locations, and navigation recommendations.

6. **Multi-platform Support**: Develops applications supporting multiple platforms (mobile app, Web, desktop) for navigation tools accessibility on different devices.
