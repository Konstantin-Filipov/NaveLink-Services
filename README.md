## Additional Navelink Information

### Identity Registry

Navelink's Identity Registry provides a higher level of security for digital communication within the maritime sector. It issues unique identity certificates to members, allowing them to verify their identity and sign sensitive communication. This ensures both the sender and receiver of information feel safe knowing they are communicating with the intended party. The Identity Registry complies with authority regulations, recommendations, and follows global data format standards compatible with pre-existing equipment.

### Service Registry

Navelink's Service Registry offers convenient access to maritime services on a common digital platform. It serves as a major enabler for service developers and consumers to connect with each other, benefitting both parties by gathering services in one place. Standardized data formats ensure compatibility with ECDIS and interoperability with other services. Approximately 80 operational services are available, including ship services, navigational warnings, VTS services, port, and pilot services.

### Navelink's Symbol

Navelink's symbol is a triangle with rounded edges and vaulted sides, standing on one of its tips. A circle is placed in the middle of each vaulted side, with a dotted line extending from each circle towards the triangle's center. The shape evokes the idea of a ship hull cross-section and a shield, symbolizing the maritime sector and safety. The dotted lines represent network nodes.
